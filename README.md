The JAR file can be executed using java -jar GoEuroTest.jar "CITY_NAME".

The program saves the CSV file in the location from where the JAR is executed.

Eg: If the jar is executed from the path /Users/xxx/Desktop, 
    then the CSV file will be stored in /Users/xxx/Desktop/CITY_NAME_CURRENT_TIMESTAMP.csv
